Welcome to my website, I'm a 3<sup>rd</sup>year Computer Science undergraduate at [IEM, Kolkata](https://iem.edu.in/) SaltLake Campus, interested in cryptography and machine learning.

Currently, I am a Summer Intern at [Presidency University](https://presiuniv.ac.in/web/) under [Prof. Avishek Adhikary](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/web/staff.php?staffid=424) working with visual cryptography, and I'm also a Research Assistant at Centre of Excellence for Cloud Computing & IoT under IEDC CSE. Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue higher studies, potentially a Ph.D., with the ultimate goal of becoming a professor in the future. 👨🏼‍🏫
